## Preparation

Create sample starter folders as zips and provide it to the user

## Steps

1. Give user Grammar Documentation
2. Get them to perform one of these tasks (increasing difficulty):

    a. Rename a single file on your computer
    
    b. Copy all files from one folder to another folder (have to create second folder with script)
    
    c. Partition all files in a folder by size. Put all files < 10 mb in one subfolder, and the others in another subfolder (Hint: Use ListVariable and Forloop)

    d. Partition all files in a folder by size and extension. Put all files < 10 mb AND extension .png in one subfolder then compress this folder, 
    and the other files move in another subfolder. (same hint as above)

For each task, check the following is true within your file system from File Explorer on your windows machine after execution of scripts:

    a. The name for the file RenameMe.txt inside Task-A folder must be changed to your choosing.
    b. A new folder with a name of your choosing should be created inside Task-B, all files from the folder CopyFrom
       should now be copied to inside your newly created folder.
    c. 2 new folders with names of your choosing created inside Task-C, one containing all the files previously existing
       in Task-C that are less than 10 MB in size, the other folder containing the rest of files.
    d. 2 new folders with names of your choosing created inside Task-D, one containing all the files previously existing
       in Task-D that are less than 10 MB in size and have extension of .png (this would be the zipped folder), the other folder containing the rest of files.
